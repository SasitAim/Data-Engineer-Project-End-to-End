### Project Overview
This data engineer ETL project will begin by importing a public dataset (Thai road accidents 2019-2022) into a MySQL database by Python. After that, the data will be cleaned using SSIS by extracting data from the SSIS database. when the cleaning process is complete, the data will be sent to the SSMS database (Assumed to be the Data Warehouse). The final step involves visualizing and analyzing the data using Power BI.

### Tools
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- MySQL
- PowerBI

### Questions
1. How many accidents occurred in each year?
2. The top 10 provinces with the highest number of accidents and the 10 provinces with the lowest number of accidents.
3. During which time periods do accidents occur most frequently?
4. The highest number of jointly involved vehicle accidents.
5. Which weather conditions have the highest number of accidents?
6. Which type of road has the highest number of accidents?
7. Number of injuries and fatalities each year.
8. Which type of accidents occurs most frequently?


## Import Data to MySQL.
### Create database in MySQL and import data. 
```sql
-- First create database 
CREATE DATABASE datade ;

USE datade ;
```

### Import data from Kaggle
```python
# import library
import opendatasets as od 
import os 
import pandas as pd


# identify the dataset's URL on Kaggle
url_data = 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thaweewatboy/thailand-road-accident-2019-2022?select=thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv'


# download dataset form kaggle by identify URL of dataset 
# used Kaggle AIP username and key
od.download(url_data)


# identify directory for save data 
data_dir = './thailand-road-accident-2019-2022'
data_dir


# download file in directory 
# output is file name 
os.listdir(data_dir)

```


### Create data frame and Connect database
```python
# Create data frame
file_path = r"{}/thai_road_accident_2019_2022.csv".format(data_dir)
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
df

# Overview of Data
df.head()
df.info()
df.isnull().sum()


# Connect to MySQL
# Import the neccessary modules
from sqlalchemy import create_engine as ce


# Detail for connect MySQL
host = 'localhost' #localhost
user = 'root' # user name
password = 'password' # Your password
database = 'database name' # Your database name


# Create connection
engine = ce(f'mysql+pymysql://{user}:{password}@{host}/{database}')


# Import DataFrame DB
df.to_sql(name='thai_RAC', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
host = 'localhost'
user = 'root'
password = 'password'
database = 'database name'


# close connections
engine.dispose()
```


### Cleaning data in MySQL.
```sql
-- SELECT database
USE datade ;
SELECT * FROM datade.thai_rac;

-- Check data type in each column
DESCRIBE thai_rac;


-- check length in each columns
 SELECT 
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(acc_code)) AS acc_code_len,
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(province_en)) AS province_en_len,
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(province_th)) AS province_th_len,  
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(agency)) AS province_th_len,
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(route)) AS province_th_len,
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(vehicle_type)) AS province_th_len,
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(presumed_cause)) AS province_th_len,
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(accident_type)) AS province_th_len,
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(weather_condition)) AS slope_description_len,
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(road_description)) AS province_th_len,
  MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(slope_description)) AS province_th_len
FROM thai_rac;


-- Change data type and 
ALTER TABLE thai_rac
MODIFY COLUMN acc_code VARCHAR (10),
MODIFY COLUMN incident_datetime TIMESTAMP,
MODIFY COLUMN report_datetime TIMESTAMP,
MODIFY COLUMN province_en VARCHAR (25),
MODIFY COLUMN province_th VARCHAR (50),
MODIFY COLUMN agency VARCHAR (35),
MODIFY COLUMN route VARCHAR (280),
MODIFY COLUMN vehicle_type VARCHAR (30),

MODIFY COLUMN accident_type VARCHAR (45),
MODIFY COLUMN weather_condition VARCHAR (20),

```

## Extract, transform and load (ETL) with SSIS.
